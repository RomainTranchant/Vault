# Apple System Security Features

As we know, Windows and Linux distributions include security features that are designed to protect endpoints. Apple provides system hardware and macOS security features that offer robust endpoint protection as well.

Apple security features include the following:

# Security-focused hardware

The hardware platform has enhanced security features such as a special security processor, boot integrity, and a dedicated AES encryption engine. These features are included in a special system on a chip called the Secure Enclave.

# Encrypted storage

Apple Data Protection and FileVault data storage encryption are supported by the hardware-based AES encryption engine. This enables encryption and decryption of files as they are written or read without exposing encryption keys to the main CPU, operating system, or running applications.

# Secure boot

The Boot ROM protects low-level hardware and only allows genuine and unaltered Apple OS software to run.

# Secure biometric data

Biometric authentication data is processed in the security hardware system. This keeps it segregated from the OS and running application software, including malware.

# Find My Mac

Find My Mac helps find lost or stolen macOS devices through its location tracking function. It also enables remote device locking and storage erasing if critical data is at risk.

# XProtect

XProtect antimalware technology prevents the execution of malware through signature-based malware detection. It also alerts users to the existence of malware and provides the option to remove detected malware files.

# Malware Removal Tool (MRT)

The Malware Removal Tool (MRT) detects and removes existing malware infections when detection rules are automatically updated by Apple. It also monitors for malware infections at system restart and user login.

# Gatekeeper

Gatekeeper ensures that only authentic, digitally-signed software that has been created by an Apple-notarized software developer is permitted to be installed.
