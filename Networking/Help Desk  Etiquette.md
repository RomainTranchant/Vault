# Help Desk Etiquette
A help desk is a specialized team in an IT department that is the central point of contact for employees or customers.

When users requires support, they must contact the IT help desk. This may be done by using an online reporting tool, live chat, telephone, or email (e.g., [IT-support@email.com](mailto:IT-support@email.com)). Help desks often use a “shared” email account. This means that all helpdesk technicians can see the email requests and respond to them accordingly.

**Note**: The online reporting tool could be integrated into the ticketing system. Often, the help desk technician may be able to quickly answer or solve user issues. For example, if an organization had an internet network failure, users may contact the help desk asking why they cannot reach external sites. The technician would inform them that the network is down, and that it should be operational within a specific time. However, if the request for support is valid, then the technician will create a “trouble ticket”. This is done using special ticketing system software to manage requests, incidents, and reported problems. These “tickets” can be created by the user using a ticketing system dashboard or by a help desk technician. Typically, a user initiates the ticket, and the help desk technician validates it.

The help desk technician may have to gather additional information about the request. When questioning users, use effective questioning techniques and listen carefully to the user answers. You may also have to physically investigate the device or connect remotely to replicate the problem, execute commands, and check configurations.

The technician would then analyze the collected data and either:

**Solve the problem** - Once the user problem has been addressed, the technician would update and close the trouble ticket. Updating the ticket solution is important because it can populate the ticketing system database. Therefore, if the same problem is reported by another user, the responding technician can search the database to quickly resolve the problem. In addition, administrators can analyze the tickets to identify common issues and their causes in order to globally eliminate the problem, if possible.

**Escalate the trouble ticket** - Some problems are more complex or require access to devices which the technician has no credentials for. In these cases, the technician must escalate (i.e., forward) the trouble ticket to a more experienced technician. It is important that all documentation captured from the user is clear, concise, and accurate.

The figure summarizes a typical trouble ticket process that a help desk technician would have to perform.

**Note**: Processes can vary depending on the organization.

# Ticketing Systems

Help desk ticketing systems help organizations manage user problems or requests. Ticketing software is specifically designed to ensure that corporate users or clients receive support in a timely and systematic manner. They also ensure that all tickets get noticed and addressed.

A shared mailbox is an alternative method that can be used by an organization to support user requests. Help desk technicians would all share the same mailbox and respond to emails to solve problems.

Ticketing systems vary depending on the need of the organization. For example, there are ticketing systems designed for the needs of internal corporate users and other systems to support service providers or external customers.

**Note**: A quick internet search for “help desk software” reveals many different software vendors including Zendesk, HaloITSM, Connectwise and more.

**Note**: Other fields may also be available, such as platform type and model, operating system version, network connection used, and others.
In the sample ticket, some fields were system generated (in orange), drop-down (in blue), or free-form (in yellow). Drop-down fields make it easier to enter and maintain consistency. The free-form fields are used by the help desk technician to add descriptive information.

Free-form fields will be read by other technicians and managers. Therefore, it is important to use clear and concise written communication. Use plain language and short sentences. Always pay attention to your spelling, grammar, and style.

# Question End Users

When requesting support from a help desk, users often provide vague and sometimes misleading information. For example, users often report problems such as “The network is down.”, “I cannot access my email.”, or “My computer is slow.” In most cases, additional information is required to fully understand the problem.

When entering the trouble ticket, the help desk technician must discover the “who”, “what”, and “when” of the problem.

The following recommendations should be employed when communicating with a user:

Always be considerate and empathize with users while letting them know you will help them solve their problem. Users reporting a problem may be under stress and anxious to resolve the problem as quickly as possible. Never talk down, belittle, insult, or accuse the user of causing the problem.

Speak at a technical level they can understand. Avoid using complex terminology or industry jargon.

Always listen or read carefully what the user is saying. Taking notes can be helpful when documenting a complex problem.

Good interpersonal skills are an asset to the helpdesk technician. It is important to develop this skill set to better serve and communicate with users and peers. For example, a technician should address a user by their preferred name, attempt to relate to the user, and work to clarify exactly what it is that they are requesting.
## Know, Relate, and Understand

When interviewing the user, guide the conversation and use effective questioning techniques to quickly ascertain the problem. Two common methods to do so, include using:

**Open-ended questions**
- These types of questions allow users to explain the details of the problem in their own words and are useful to obtain general information.

**Closed-ended questions**
- These are simple yes, no, or single word answers that can be used to discover important facts about the network problem.
# Active listening

To better understand the problem reported by the user, practice active listening skills. Allow the customer to tell the whole story. During the time that the customer is explaining the problem, occasionally interject some small word or phrase, such as “I understand,” “Yes,” “I see,” or “Okay.” This behavior lets the customer know that you are there and that you are listening.

However, a technician should not interrupt the customer to ask a question or make a statement. This is rude, disrespectful, and creates tension. Often in a conversation, you might find yourself thinking of what to say before the other person finishes talking. When you do this, you are not actively listening. Instead, listen carefully when your customers speak, and let them finish their thoughts.

You asked the customer to explain the problem to you. This is an open-ended question. An open-ended question rarely has a simple answer. Usually, it involves information about what the customer was doing, what they were trying to do, and why they are frustrated.

After you have listened to the customer explain the whole problem, summarize what the customer has said. This helps convince the customer that you have heard and understand the situation. A good practice for clarification is to paraphrase the customer’s explanation by beginning with the words, “Let me see if I understand what you have told me.” This is a very effective tool that demonstrates to the customer that you have listened and that you understand.

After you have assured the customer that you understand the problem, you will probably have to ask some follow-up questions. Make sure that these questions are pertinent. Do not ask questions that the customer has already answered while describing the problem. Doing this only irritates the customer and shows that you were not listening.

Follow-up questions should be targeted closed-ended questions based on the information that you have already gathered. Closed-ended questions should focus on obtaining specific information. The customer should be able to answer a closed-ended question with a simple “yes” or “no” or with a factual response, such as “Windows 10.”

Use all the information that you have gathered from the customer to complete the trouble ticket.

Document the user-provided information in the trouble ticket. Include anything that you think might be important for you or another technician. The small details often lead to the solution of a difficult or complicated problem.

When the ticket has been completed, the technician should repeat their understanding of the problem to the user to ensure that you both agree on the problem being reported.

# Gather Information for Host-Related Tickets

The ticketing system often includes sections for entering host-related information. These fields are often completed during the “Gather Information” step of the troubleshooting life cycle.

Useful host-related information include:

- Host manufacturer, model, serial number
- Operating system version
- Network environment (i.e., wired, wireless, …)
- Network connectivity test results (ping, tracert, …)

Additional information that can be captured from a host include:

- Beep codes
- Event Viewer logs
- Device Manager settings
- Task Manager data
- Diagnostic tool results

# Analyze the Information

Now that the trouble ticket has been created and information has been gathered, the technician must analyze the information. To accomplish this, the technician relies on their experience, knowledge bases, and other information sourcesto decide if they can solve the problem. The technician may also communicate with peers to gain insight on the problem.

Knowledge bases that can be searched include:

- **Ticketing software databases** - Most ticketing systems build a repository of previous tickets that can be searched to see if another technician resolved an identical or similar problem.
- **Vendor resources** - Vendorsmaintain Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) documents that can be searched and may also offer online tools to help resolve problems. Some offer live chats to solve problems faster.
- **Online internet searches** - Using search engines to see if a problem has been encountered before.

If the problem cannot be solved, then the ticket must be escalated to a more experienced IT staff member.
